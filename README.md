Auto-Scaling VM Script 🚀
This script automatically starts or deletes a Google Cloud VM (scaled-vm) based on CPU usage.

How It Works
CPU > 75% → Starts a VM if not running.
CPU < 50% → Deletes the VM if running.
50% ≤ CPU ≤ 75% → No action taken.
Usage
Ensure you have gcloud CLI installed & authenticated.
Run the script:
bash
Copy
Edit
./monitor_cpu.sh
Monitor logs to see VM creation or deletion.
Requirements
Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)
Bash Shell
Notes
The VM uses Ubuntu 22.04 LTS in us-west3-a.
Modify THRESHOLD_UP & THRESHOLD_DOWN as needed.
🚀 Automate scaling & save costs!
